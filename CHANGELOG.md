v0.2.0
======
Migration:
----------
There are new values which have to be added to the configuration file. Take a look at the example file or generate a new one interactively using ```./bot editconfig```.
You will need to install all new dependencies and upgrade outdated ones by rebuilding them using ```npm install```.
Additionally there are two new permissions "log" and "be-quiet". You will need to add them to at least one user in order to grant them to anyone. To do this find out your database user id (Take a look at the ```Users``` table) and then execute the following SQL queries (substitute [userid] with your user id):
```
INSERT INTO UserPermissions(user, permission) VALUES([userid], 'be-quiet');
INSERT INTO UserPermissions(user, permission) VALUES([userid], 'log');
```

  shutdown.
* Users can have permission which are defined in the database schema. Certain
