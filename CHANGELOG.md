v0.1.0
======

Relevant changes:
-----------------
* Pressing CTRL^C will now shutdown the bot gently. A second CTRL^C forces the
  shutdown.
* Users can have permission which are defined in the database schema. Certain
  commands and other operations may require permissions. See file
  *src/permissions.js* for further information on how to use them. It is also
  possible to register a command which needs a permission. Have a look at the
  docs.
* Added permissions for the following things:
	* Login,
	* Kick users,
	* Upload music,
	* Shutdown the bot,
	* Add a quote,
	* Grant permissions
* Commands can now receive the user which issued the command as well as the
  source the command came from. Currently sources can be the following:
	* steam
	* minecraft
	* mumble (chat and voice)
	* website
	* terminal

  Please note that commands issued from the terminal can not have a user but
  always ignore permissions.
* Commands can now have arguments which need to be from a predefined list when
  registering the commands so the grammar can be created accordingly.
* Commands with arguments can be issued from the website with a dropdown-button.
* Massive addition of documentation but still not yet done.
* Added command "kick" which will kick a user by his identifier.
* Added command "who is" which will tell the user assigned to this identifier.
* Users can now link mumble users to their account.

Bugfixes:
---------
* Fixed a bug with the database crashing the bot.
* Fixed commanding via steam.
* Fixed commands issued via website executed twice.
* Fixed website not to display music section.
